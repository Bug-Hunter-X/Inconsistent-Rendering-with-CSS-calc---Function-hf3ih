The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when using the `calc()` function with multiple units.  For instance, `width: calc(50% - 10px);` might not render as expected in certain browsers or contexts, particularly when dealing with nested elements or complex layouts.  The issue is subtle and might not be immediately apparent, especially for developers who are not extensively familiar with the limitations of the `calc()` function, especially in edge cases. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or visual inconsistencies across different browsers or screen sizes.
